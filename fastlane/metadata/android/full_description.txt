InstaGrabber is an app that allows...

* Viewing **and downloading** Instagram posts, stories (including highlights)\*, DM\*, and profile pictures, **without** letting people know you viewed it! Works for followed private accounts\*!
* Like/bookmark posts\*!
* Downloading multiple posts at once (hold & select)!
* (Un)follow/restrict/block people\*, and (un)follow hashtags\*! (Or you can add shortcuts to them, without logging in!)
* **Copy** post captions, comments, DM messages\*, and profile bios.
* **Compare** follower/following list!
* Searching usernames and hashtags.

<sub>* Requires [login](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/instagrabber/blob/master/README.md#how-to-log-in). You must be a current follower of the desired private accounts, this app cannot hack people (which I have to state despite the obvious)!</sub>

It can be used as a drop-in replacement for read functionalities of the official Instagram app, with unnecessary components stripped.
