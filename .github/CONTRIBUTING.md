## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in InstaGrabber! As we grow in popularity, it becomes apparent that we are short on hands. Every contribution counts!

### I can code Java!

Great!

Generally, we want to imitate features in the actual Instagram app. There are many Instagram private API repositories on GitHub for you to refer to. Note that you should minimize POST: If a job should be done with GET, then there has to be a GET endpoint. (Indeed, sometimes you need multiple repositories for reference.)

As long as you have tested your version (please indicate device and API version) and make sure it works, then you can submit a PR! Large UI changes have to be voted on by the community, so it would be helpful to upload some screenshots.

Check errors are for reference only. Try to minimize them, but usually they don't make a big difference.

### I can't code Java, but I want to!

Fun fact: Austin took over this project and learned Java on the fly (I'm not joking, I only do JavaScript before taking this over).

Even though Java is quite annoying, it is still possible to learn it by trying to understand what these code do (Easier if you have coding experience in other languages).

If you have questions, don't be afraid t ask for help!

### I found a bug!

Bugs are inevitable during active development, as nobody can cover all the possible test cases. You can either email your crash dump to `instagrabber@austinhuang.me` (The crash reporter will fill in this email for you) or create a GitHub issue.

If you're on GitHub, please follow the template.
