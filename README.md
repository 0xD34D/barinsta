## InstaGrabber

InstaGrabber is an app that allows ~~stealing~~ downloading Instagram posts, stories, and DM. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for read functionalities of the Instagram app.

This app is originally made by [@AwaisKing](https://github.com/AwaisKing) who posted on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/AwaisKing/instagrabber). I decided to continue the app cuz why not, ~~even though it might not be that *cash money*.~~ (Also I need to learn Java.)

### Download

Download [here](https://github.com/austinhuang0131/instagrabber/releases). Under each release is an `app-release.apk`. Just install that. Unfortunately, I have to sign it with my own key, which means you have to uninstall the old app and log in again. Sorry.

### How to log in

Original instructions are [here](https://gitlab.com/AwaisKing/instagrabber/-/wikis/home#how-to-login-eli5-1).
